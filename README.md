## 🧭 What is Chronix?

Chronix is built from the open‑source Batocera Linux project—a plug‑and‑play console-like OS that boots from SD or USB and supports 200+ game systems out of the box.  
All Batocera code is licensed under **LGPL v3**, with many upstream components under GPL, BSD, MIT, or non‑commercial licenses.
