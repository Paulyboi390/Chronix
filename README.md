# Chronix Retro OS - v1.0.0  
**Chronix — Retro Reloaded**  

**Chronix** is a lightweight rebrand of Batocera Linux, optimized for the BATLEXP G350 handheld. Just like Batocera, it’s open-source and ready to game—now with your personal flair.

##  What Is Chronix?  
A fork of Batocera tailored specifically for the BATLEXP G350. It maintains compatibility with Batocera's ecosystem—including themes, ports, and emulators—but offers new aesthetics and usability improvements. Built on top of the stable, open-source foundation that Batocera provides.

##  Highlights in v1.0.0  
- **RetroArch Launcher (in *Ports*)**  
   A custom RetroArch launcher inside the Ports section. The default RetroArch option in EmulationStation is disabled—use the Ports option for now.

- **Custom Theme & Boot Logo**  
   Branded visuals that set Chronix apart from vanilla Batocera.

- **"Chronix Retro OS" Branding**  
   The OS name in `etc/os-release` is updated to make it official.

- **Splash Screen Assets**  
   New graphics under `usr/share/batocera/splash/` for that polished boot experience.
